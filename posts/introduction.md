Hello, I started this blog to keep track of my progress.

For a few months starting september, I'll try to post a few times per week, mostly technical stuff.

A few themes I'll be bloging about include : 
- Custom [avalanche subnets](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4064861-what-is-a-subnet) using [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)
- Iot related tutorials - I just purchased two of these [boards](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-ZigBee/) and I am starting with zero knowledge.
- Probably a lot of other random stuff

Hope you have fun following me :)
